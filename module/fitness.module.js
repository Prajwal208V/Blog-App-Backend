Created by Amy Eisinger, C.P.T., this workout will test your endurance all the way through. And then just when you think you’re done, there’s a cardio burnout at the end that’ll give you one last challenge. You can make it easier or harder by tweaking the amount of rest you take between exercises in the circuit.', avatar: '' },

This HIIT workout, which was created by Equinox group fitness instructor Colleen Conlon, is kinder on the joints than most HIIT workouts, since it includes lower-impact moves like side kick throughs and crab toe touches. There still are some moves that are a little higher impact, like skater hops, so if you’re not sure if this workout would be safe for you, talk to your doctor or physical therapist first.', avatar: '' },

Then you’ll have to give this routine, created by Eisinger, a try. The circuit will cycle through five moves, which work everything from your legs (squat pulse), core (tuck-up), and shoulders (frogger). Once you complete the circuit for your chosen number of rounds, you’ll finish with a AMRAP (as many reps as possible) finisher.', avatar: '' },

And a great way to do that is through variations of the plank, where your shoulders and triceps really put in the work. Created by certified trainer Lita Lewis, this workout will start with skaters to get your blood pumping, and then take you to the floor for the next three plank-based moves: push-up, shoulder tap, and plank forearm reach. The second circuit is heavy on the plank variations too, with the plank jack and forearm plank. You’ll be tasked with holding the plank for a good chunk of time with these moves (since they’re back-to-back-to-back), so if it’s too hard to maintain with good form, drop to your knees to make it a bit easier.', avatar: '' },

Then this HIIT workout is the routine for you. Created by Conlon, this total-body bodyweight workout gets you moving in multiple planes of motion to work all your different muscle groups. The exercises she chose—moves like the lateral shuffle and explosive crab reach—allow you to move at a pace where you can really ramp up the intensity, which is vital for HIIT workouts. Hint: Try performing each move 10 times on its own at a comfortable intensity before moving into the workout, so you are familiar with any new exercises.', avatar: '' },

This 30-minute workout doubles as a cardio routine (no running required), so give it a shot if you are looking to get sweaty. You can choose rest-work periods based off your fitness level, so it’s a great workout for those who are just getting started.', avatar: '' },

The not-so-good part? Abs workouts can be superhard, which is why we’re all for one that’s over in eight minutes. With this at-home workout, which was created by Amy Marturana Winderl, C.P.T., you’ll spend 30 seconds on five separate exercises, including dead bug, forearm plank rock, and plank up-down, taking no rest between the moves until the circuit is complete. After three rounds, your abs will definitely be burning.', avatar: '' },

Created by Marturana Winderl, this bodyweight workout uses five variations of the plank, including plank up-downs (which light up your shoulders and triceps) and plank jacks (to give a cardio element). Check out these tips to make a plank more effective before you get started, so you can make sure you are making the most of every exercise.', avatar: '' },

If you’re just getting started, try each move for 30 seconds with 30 seconds of rest. As you get more comfortable with exercising, you can increase your work time and decrease your rest for more of a cardio challenge.', avatar: '' },

This four-move workout, which was created by Cori Lefkowith, NASM-certified personal trainer and owner of Redefining Strength in Costa Mesa, California, proves you don’t need any equipment for a good butt workout. Moves like frog bridges and straight-leg fire hydrant ensure you are working your gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus.', avatar: '' },

There are nine exercises in the workout, which seems like a lot, but it only takes 15 minutes to finish. Your shoulders and triceps will totally be feeling it by the time you’re done.', avatar: '' },
